## Jobs @ Fred Hutch



### For current students at University of Washington

If you are a current University of Wasthington student and are interested in working with me come by my office any time the door is open and I'll be happy to talk about open projects. 

I am always excited to talk to students about new projects, it is the [best part of the job](http://simplystatistics.org/2012/10/26/i-love-those-first-discussions-about-a-new-research/)

I will be extra pumped to talk to you if:

1. You know something about our projects
2. Double that if you have used any of our software, data, training programs, etc.
3. Triple that if you have contributed to any of our software, data, training programs, etc. 
4. Quadruple that if you come with your own idea related to anything I work on

If our projects don't seem that interesting to you, I'm also happy to help introduce you to other folks in data science or genomics who might have projects you are more interested in. 

### For prospective students at University of Washington

I mostly supervise students from [Biostatistics]([http://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/)), but am also excited to work with students in any department at UW. I am not on the admissions committee so I pretty much don't have any say over whether you will get admitted. But if you want to do a Ph.D. at UW and have written a cool R package and put it on Github or done an awesome data analysis and posted it on the web, then I want to hear from you! Send me an email with your CV attached, a link to your project, and a one liner about the coolest research project you can think of that relates to anything me or any of my colleagues do. I'll make sure the right people see your application. 

### For prospective postdocs

I am always looking for awesome potential postdocs. There are some positions that I have funded to tackle specific ideas related to our projects. But if you have an interesting idea you'd like to take on, I can probably figure out a way to scrounge up the money to pay for it if you can sell me on it :). 

Here are the minimum things I look for in a postdoc:

* Completed a PhD in a relevant data-oriented field 
* Has experience in using data to answer interesting questions
* [Problem forward philosophy](https://simplystatistics.org/posts/2013-05-29-what-statistics-should-do-about-big-data-problem-forward-not-solution-backward/)
* Has read about our projects and is excited about being a leader on one or more of them 
* Has at least one idea they want to work on unrelated to their dissertation

If you are interested in doing a postdoc send me an email with your CV and a short (one paragraph) description of a research project you have imagined working on. If you are a grad student who is interested in applying for postdoctoral funding through NSF, NIH, or another funding source and want to work with me, send me an email with the above information and I'll be happy to help you with your application. You can also check out job openings by going to the [Fred Hutch Postdoc Openings Webpage](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/about/careers/job-openings.html?c=C19774) and searching for Leek under the keyword. 


### About our group

The Leek group is committed to being a welcoming place to all students, postdocs, faculty and collaborators (see our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/jtleek/coc/blob/main/README.md)). We work together on projects, share credit liberally, encourage and support each other, and try to solve problems that make the world a better place. We have hired economists, computer scientists, geneticists, biologists, social workers, and everything in between. We have hired people with everything from GED level education to postdoctoral level education and all are treated equally as team contributors. We support flexible work arrangements, remote work, and are committed to life-work balance in everything we do. We believe excellence is defined broadly and want to encourage people to build on their personal strengths and learn new things. We have a great track record of helping people achieve their goals in research, careers, and life and would love to work with you!
